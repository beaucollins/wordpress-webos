    "content": "I've been contemplating a few different interface paradigms. I think the larger screens/keyboards of tablets lends themselves to being better writing environments for longer form articles vs what phones are useful for (fast updates). So make writing a really pleasant experience.\n\nI'm going to try to wireframe all of these ideas to make everything more clear.\n\n<strong>WordPress for iPad</strong>:\nTwo panes. Left is for navigating (drill down, back out, lists of Posts/Pages/Comments) right pane is for detail view. Each blog is it's own \"silo\" of info.\n\n<strong>WebOS Email Client Clone</strong>:\nYou would get one big screen with 3 panes. The left pain would list your accounts and then you could expand them to show Posts/Pages/Comments/Stats line items. The second pane will show the list view of whatever you selected (Posts/Pages/Comments/Stats). The detail pane would then show a single detailed view. You get a better high level view of what's going on. It's more or less Outlook in widescreen mode.\n\n<strong>Combined Accounts</strong>:\nThis would be a departure from how most of the WordPress clients work now. The main idea being as you add accounts all of the data is kind of mixed together. For instance when you view the comments it will show one single timeline of all comments from all blogs. You could filter for a specific blog or comment status but from a user experience standpoint, there is one place you go to see comments in the app.",
