WordPress for webOS
===================

Create and manage posts and pages. Moderate and respond to comments. Get
notified when new comments arrive. This app is built on the new webOS
framework that is optimized for the TouchPad.

Development
-----------

In order to run the app you must download the currently private/NDA framework
from the [Palm Developer Network][palm]. You must register in the prerelease
program to receive access to the framework.

Once downloaded you must update `index.html` to have the `<script>` element
point to the downloaded framework. Once the path is corrected, open
`index.html` in your favorite WebKit browser to run the application.
